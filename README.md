## General info
From scratch self-made home alarm system with gas sensor to ensure the safety of residents.
Adaptable system can be modified to gather information from other sensors like flood, carbon monoxide, etc according to residents demends.
System board is powered from the power supply or from battery in case of power failure.
Information about exceed sensor value is send to declared phone number via SMS.
